- LLM Math Prompting

The goal of this project is to explore and evaluate the capabilities of a **Large Language Model (LLM)** — specifically **Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2** — in tackling and solving **mathematical problems of varying difficulty**.

**Prompting Strategies**
The implemented prompting strategies are:
- Chain-of-Thought  
- Zero-shot  
- Iterative  
- Few-shot
